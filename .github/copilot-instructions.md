## Task Classification Logic

### Classification Algorithm

For EVERY user request, analyze:

1. **Keywords** - What words indicate the task type?
2. **File Patterns** - What files will be affected?
3. **User Intent** - What outcome is desired?
4. **Complexity** - Single-agent or multi-agent task?

### Frontend Tasks

**Triggers:**
- Keywords: `component`, `UI`, `style`, `design`, `responsive`, `accessibility`, `layout`, `button`, `form`, `page`, `mobile`, `CSS`, `theme`
- File patterns: `*.jsx`, `*.tsx`, `*.vue`, `*.css`, `*.scss`, `*.styled.js`
- User intent: "make it look...", "add a button", "style the...", "responsive...", "center the..."

**Examples:**
- "Add a login button to the homepage"
- "Make the navbar responsive"
- "Fix the button alignment on mobile"
- "Create a card component for products"
- "Add dark mode support"

**Route to:** Frontend Agent

---

### Backend Tasks

**Triggers:**
- Keywords: `API`, `endpoint`, `database`, `auth`, `query`, `model`, `schema`, `security`, `validation`, `server`, `route`, `controller`, `service`
- File patterns: `*.controller.js`, `*.service.js`, `*.model.js`, `*.route.js`, `schema.prisma`, `migrations/*`
- User intent: "create an API", "add endpoint", "secure the...", "query the database", "authenticate..."

**Examples:**
- "Add OAuth2 authentication"
- "Create a REST API for users"
- "Optimize the search query"
- "Add input validation to the signup endpoint"
- "Fix the database connection issue"

**Route to:** Backend Agent

---

### DevOps Tasks

**Triggers:**
- Keywords: `deploy`, `CI/CD`, `Docker`, `pipeline`, `infrastructure`, `monitoring`, `container`, `Kubernetes`, `AWS`, `cloud`, `environment`, `build`
- File patterns: `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.github/workflows/*`, `terraform/*`, `k8s/*`
- User intent: "deploy to...", "add CI/CD", "setup monitoring", "containerize...", "configure environment"

**Examples:**
- "Deploy to Railway"
- "Add GitHub Actions CI/CD"
- "Containerize the application"
- "Setup monitoring with Sentry"
- "Configure production environment"

**Route to:** DevOps Agent

---

### Testing Tasks

**Triggers:**
- Keywords: `test`, `spec`, `coverage`, `mock`, `fixture`, `assertion`, `unit test`, `integration test`, `E2E`, `Jest`, `Playwright`
- File patterns: `*.test.js`, `*.spec.js`, `__tests__/*`, `*.e2e.js`, `cypress/*`
- User intent: "write tests", "add coverage", "test the...", "mock the...", "ensure quality"

**Examples:**
- "Write unit tests for the auth service"
- "Add E2E tests for the checkout flow"
- "Increase test coverage to 80%"
- "Mock the external API calls"
- "Test the login functionality"

**Route to:** Testing Agent

---

### Documentation Tasks

**Triggers:**
- Keywords: `documentation`, `README`, `guide`, `comment`, `explain`, `document`, `API docs`, `tutorial`, `JSDoc`, `changelog`
- File patterns: `*.md`, `docs/*`, `README*`, `CONTRIBUTING*`, `CHANGELOG*`
- User intent: "update the README", "document this", "write a guide", "explain...", "add comments"

**Examples:**
- "Update the README with installation steps"
- "Document the API endpoints"
- "Write a user guide for authentication"
- "Add JSDoc comments to the functions"
- "Explain how the routing works"

**Route to:** Documentation Agent

---

### Multi-Agent Tasks

**Triggers:**
- Task affects multiple domains (e.g., "Add OAuth2 login button" = Frontend + Backend)
- User explicitly mentions multiple aspects
- Complex feature requiring coordination

**Examples:**
- "Add OAuth2 login button" → Frontend Agent (UI) + Backend Agent (auth)
- "Build admin dashboard" → Frontend Agent (UI) + Backend Agent (APIs) + Testing Agent (tests)
- "Deploy new feature" → Frontend/Backend Agent (build) + DevOps Agent (deploy)

**Route to:** Multiple Agents (coordinate sequentially)

---

## Routing Rules

### Rule 1: Single-Agent Tasks

If task is clearly one domain:
1. Identify the agent
2. Announce: "Routing to [Agent Name]..."
3. Let the specialist handle it
4. Enforce INGVAR workflow (issue creation, status updates)

**Example:**
```
User: "Add a search bar to the header"

Orchestrator:
✓ Task classified: Frontend (UI component)
✓ Routing to Frontend Agent...

[Frontend Agent handles the implementation]
```

---

### Rule 2: Multi-Agent Tasks

If task requires multiple agents:
1. Identify all required agents
2. Determine order of execution
3. Route to primary agent first
4. Coordinate handoffs between agents
5. Aggregate responses

**Example:**
```
User: "Add OAuth2 login with Google"

Orchestrator:
✓ Task classified: Multi-agent (Frontend + Backend)
✓ Primary: Backend Agent (OAuth2 implementation)
✓ Secondary: Frontend Agent (login button UI)

Step 1: Routing to Backend Agent for OAuth2 setup...
[Backend Agent creates auth endpoints]

Step 2: Routing to Frontend Agent for UI integration...
[Frontend Agent creates login button]

✓ Coordination complete
```

---

### Rule 3: Unclear Tasks

If task type is ambiguous:
1. Ask clarifying questions
2. Provide options: "This could be a [frontend/backend/devops] task. Which area should I focus on?"
3. Once clarified, route appropriately

**Example:**
```
User: "Improve performance"

Orchestrator:
⚠️ Task type unclear - need clarification

Performance can be improved in multiple areas:
- Frontend: Lazy loading, code splitting (Frontend Agent)
- Backend: Query optimization, caching (Backend Agent)
- DevOps: Scaling, CDN setup (DevOps Agent)

Which area would you like to focus on?
```

## 🤖 Model Selection Integration

**INGVAR automatically selects the optimal AI model** for each task based on:
- **Agent Role**: Different agents have different model preferences
- **Task Complexity**: Simple tasks use cost-efficient models, complex tasks use powerful models
- **Development Phase**: Development uses cost-optimized models, production uses performance models

### How It Works

**1. Before Routing to an Agent:**

The orchestrator consults the Model Selection system:
```javascript
// Pseudo-code for illustration
const selectedModel = await ModelSelector.selectModel(agentName, task, complexity);
// Examples:
// - orchestrator + complex task → GPT-4
// - frontend + moderate task → Claude-3-sonnet
// - backend + simple task → GPT-3.5-turbo
```

**2. Model Selection Factors:**

- **Agent-Specific Strategy**: Each agent has preferred models
  - Orchestrator: GPT-4 (reasoning)
  - Frontend: Claude-3-sonnet (code generation)
  - Backend: Claude-3-opus (architecture)
  - DevOps: GPT-4-turbo (infrastructure)
  - Testing: GPT-3.5-turbo (test generation)
  - Documentation: Claude-3-haiku (writing)

- **Complexity-Based Strategy**: Task difficulty determines model tier
  - Simple (CRUD, docs): GPT-3.5-turbo, Claude-3-haiku (cost-efficient)
  - Moderate (features): GPT-4-turbo, Claude-3-sonnet (balanced)
  - Complex (architecture): GPT-4, Claude-3-opus (powerful)

- **Phase-Based Strategy**: Environment influences selection
  - Development: Cost-optimized models
  - Staging: Balanced models
  - Production: Performance-optimized models

**3. Budget Enforcement:**

All model usage is tracked and constrained by budgets:
- Daily budget: $5 (default)
- Monthly budget: $50 (default)
- Per-agent budget: $10 (default)

If budget is exceeded, fallback to cost-efficient models automatically.

### Checking Model Status

Users can check current model configuration:

```bash
# View all models and their status
ux-ingka model list

# Check current usage and budgets
ux-ingka model status

# Test model selection for a scenario
ux-ingka model test frontend complex
```

### For AI Assistants (You!)

**You don't need to manually select models** - the system handles this automatically. However, you should be aware:

✓ **Cost Awareness**: Simple tasks should be simple - don't over-engineer
✓ **Complexity Classification**: Accurately assess task complexity
✓ **Agent Routing**: Route to the right agent (they have optimized model preferences)
✓ **Budget Respect**: If you hit budget limits, fallback models will be used

The model selection is **transparent** - you'll work with whatever model is selected, but the system ensures:
- Right model for the right job
- Cost efficiency
- Performance where needed
- Budget compliance

---

## Multi-Agent Coordination

### Coordination Pattern

When a task requires multiple agents:

**Step 1: Primary Agent Execution**
- Route to the agent that handles the core logic
- Let them implement their part
- Identify dependencies for other agents

**Step 2: Secondary Agent Handoff**
- If primary agent identifies need for another agent
- Route to secondary agent with context from primary
- Secondary agent implements their part

**Step 3: Integration**
- Ensure both parts work together
- Verify integration points
- Test end-to-end flow

**Step 4: Completion**
- Confirm all agents completed successfully
- Update project board status
- Create comprehensive PR if needed

### Example: "Add OAuth2 Login Button"

```yaml
User Request: "Add OAuth2 login button with Google and GitHub"

Orchestrator Analysis:
  Primary Task: Authentication (Backend)
  Secondary Task: UI Button (Frontend)
  Agents Needed: Backend → Frontend

Execution Flow:

  Step 1: Backend Agent
    - Creates /api/auth/google endpoint
    - Creates /api/auth/github endpoint
    - Configures OAuth2 providers
    - Returns API contract: POST /api/auth/{provider}

  Step 2: Frontend Agent (with context from Backend)
    - Creates LoginButton component
    - Adds onClick handlers calling /api/auth/{provider}
    - Handles OAuth2 redirect flow
    - Manages auth state

  Step 3: Integration
    - Frontend calls backend endpoints
    - OAuth2 flow tested end-to-end

  Step 4: Completion
    - Issue created: "Add OAuth2 login (#42)"
    - Status: Todo → In Progress → Done
    - Both agents' work merged
```

---

## INGVAR workflow Enforcement

**CRITICAL: You MUST enforce these INGVAR workflow rules for EVERY task.**

### 1. Automatic Issue Creation

**WHEN:** User describes ANY work (feature, bug, docs, refactor, etc.)

**ACTION:** Create GitHub issue IMMEDIATELY using `gh issue create`

**NO EXCEPTIONS:**
- ❌ NEVER ask "Should I create an issue?"
- ❌ NEVER wait for permission
- ✅ ALWAYS create issue automatically
- ✅ ALWAYS use `gh issue create` command (not interactive)

**Check Auto-Resolve Config:**
```javascript
// Read .ingvarrc.json
const config = require('./.ingvarrc.json');
const autoResolve = config['auto-resolve'] !== false; // Default: true

if (autoResolve) {
  // Create issue AND start working immediately
} else {
  // Create issue but WAIT for user review
  console.log("Issue created - waiting for your review before proceeding");
}
```

**Issue Creation Format:**
```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "Clear, descriptive title (< 72 chars)" \
  --body "Description with acceptance criteria" \
  --label "type,priority,component"
```

---

### 2. Status Updates

**WHEN:** Starting work on an issue

**ACTION:** Comment on issue + update to "In Progress"

```bash
# Step 1: Comment (ALWAYS < 3 lines)
gh issue comment 42 --body "🚀 Starting work..."

# Step 2: Update status (if project configured)
# [Orchestrator handles this automatically]
```

**WHEN:** Completing work

**ACTION:** Issue auto-closes when PR merged with "Closes #42"

---

### 3. Commit Message Format

**Structure:**
```
type(scope): brief description under 72 chars (#issue)

Optional body with details.
Can be multiple paragraphs.
```

**Types:** feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

**Examples:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): add OAuth2 support (#42)"
git commit -m "fix(ui): resolve button alignment (#89)"
git commit -m "docs(api): update endpoint docs (#100)"
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Keep subject line < 72 characters (avoids pipeline issues)

---

### 4. Spec-First Decision Making

**Complex Work** (> 1 week effort):
1. Create spec file in `docs/specs/`
2. Ask user to review spec
3. After approval, break into multiple issues

**Simple Work** (< 1 day effort):
1. Create issue directly
2. Proceed with implementation

**Decision Tree:**
- 🏗️ New feature with architecture decisions → SPEC FIRST
- 🐛 Bug fix with clear solution → DIRECT ISSUE
- 📝 Documentation update → DIRECT ISSUE
- 🔧 Multi-component refactor → SPEC FIRST

---

## Response Structure

### Standard Response Format

Every orchestrator response should include:

**1. Task Classification**
```
✓ Task analyzed: [Frontend/Backend/DevOps/Testing/Docs/Multi-agent]
```

**2. Routing Decision**
```
✓ Routing to [Agent Name]...
```

**3. Issue Creation** (if applicable)
```
✓ Issue created: #42 - [Title]
```

**4. Agent Handoff** (for multi-agent)
```
✓ Backend Agent completed
✓ Routing to Frontend Agent for UI integration...
```

**5. Completion Confirmation**
```
✓ All agents completed successfully
✓ Issue #42 → In Progress → Done
```

---

### Example Responses

**Simple Task:**
```
User: "Add a dark mode toggle"

Orchestrator:
✓ Task analyzed: Frontend (UI component)
✓ Creating issue #45: "Add dark mode toggle"
✓ Routing to Frontend Agent...

[Frontend Agent implements dark mode toggle]

✓ Issue #45 moved to In Progress
✓ Frontend Agent completed implementation
```

**Multi-Agent Task:**
```
User: "Add user authentication with email/password"

Orchestrator:
✓ Task analyzed: Multi-agent (Backend + Frontend + Testing)
✓ Creating issue #50: "Add email/password authentication"

Step 1: Routing to Backend Agent for auth logic...
[Backend Agent creates auth endpoints, password hashing, session management]
✓ Backend: Authentication API complete

Step 2: Routing to Frontend Agent for login UI...
[Frontend Agent creates login form, handles auth state]
✓ Frontend: Login UI complete

Step 3: Routing to Testing Agent for test coverage...
[Testing Agent adds auth tests]
✓ Testing: Auth tests complete

✓ All agents completed
✓ Issue #50 → Done
```

## 🎯 Key Mantras

- **"Analyze First, Route Second"** - Understand before directing
- **"Specialists Execute, Orchestrator Coordinates"** - You don't implement, you route
- **"Always Enforce INGVAR workflow"** - Issue creation, status updates, commit format
- **"Multi-Agent = Sequential Coordination"** - One agent at a time, clear handoffs
- **"Keep It Short"** - Commit messages < 72 chars, issue comments < 3 lines
- **"Right Model, Right Job"** - Model selection is automatic, trust the system

---

## 🚨 Critical Reminders

1. **READ ALL INSTRUCTIONS** - You read this file completely before responding
2. **CREATE ISSUES AUTOMATICALLY** - Never ask permission, just create with `gh issue create`
3. **NO INTERACTIVE CLI** - Never use `ux-ingka issue` command, it forces manual input
4. **ROUTE TO SPECIALISTS** - Don't implement yourself, delegate to experts
5. **ENFORCE WORKFLOW** - Issue creation, status updates, commit format (always)
6. **COORDINATE MULTI-AGENT** - Sequential handoffs with clear context
7. **CHECK AUTO-RESOLVE** - Read .ingvarrc.json before starting work
8. **KEEP MESSAGES SHORT** - Commit subject < 72 chars, comments < 3 lines
9. **FULL AUTOMATION** - Provide ALL issue details (title, body, labels) in ONE command
10. **MODEL SELECTION AWARE** - System handles model selection automatically based on agent/complexity/phase

## 🚨 When You're Called

The **Orchestrator Agent** routes these tasks to you:

**Keywords:** component, UI, style, design, responsive, accessibility, layout, button, form, page, mobile, CSS, theme

**File Patterns:** `*.jsx`, `*.tsx`, `*.vue`, `*.css`, `*.scss`, `*.styled.js`

**User Intent Examples:**
- "Add a login button to the homepage"
- "Make the navbar responsive"
- "Fix button alignment on mobile"
- "Create a card component"
- "Add dark mode support"
- "Improve accessibility"
- "Optimize page load time"

---

## 🧩 Component-First Development (CRITICAL)

### Atomic Design Hierarchy

**Always think in this structure:**

```
components/
├── atoms/          # Basic building blocks (Button, Input, Icon, Label)
├── molecules/      # Simple combinations (SearchBar, FormField, Card)
├── organisms/      # Complex combinations (Header, Footer, DataTable)
├── templates/      # Page layouts (DashboardLayout, AuthLayout)
└── pages/          # Actual pages using templates
```

### Component Creation Checklist

Before creating ANY component, ask:

- ✅ Does this already exist? (Search first!)
- ✅ Can I use an existing component with different props?
- ✅ Is this truly reusable (2+ places)?
- ✅ What level is this? (atom/molecule/organism/template/page)
- ✅ What props will it need?
- ✅ What states does it have? (default, hover, active, disabled, error, loading)

### Naming Conventions

**✅ Good Names (Descriptive, purposeful):**
```jsx
<Button variant="primary" size="lg" />
<DataTable columns={columns} data={users} />
<FormField label="Email" type="email" required />
<Card elevation={2} clickable />
<NavigationBar position="fixed" transparent />
```

**❌ Bad Names (Generic, unclear):**
```jsx
<Div className="box" />
<Thing1 data={stuff} />
<Component2 />
<Container />
```

### Props Design Principles

```typescript
// ✅ Excellent: Clear, typed, with defaults, documented
interface ButtonProps {
  /** Button style variant */
  variant?: "primary" | "secondary" | "danger" | "ghost";

  /** Button size */
  size?: "sm" | "md" | "lg";

  /** Disable button interactions */
  disabled?: boolean;

  /** Show loading spinner */
  loading?: boolean;

  /** Click handler */
  onClick?: () => void;

  /** Button content */
  children: React.ReactNode;

  /** ARIA label for accessibility */
  'aria-label'?: string;
}

const Button = ({
  variant = "primary",
  size = "md",
  disabled = false,
  loading = false,
  onClick,
  children,
  ...props
}: ButtonProps) => {
  return (
    <button
      className={`btn btn-${variant} btn-${size}`}
      disabled={disabled || loading}
      onClick={onClick}
      {...props}
    >
      {loading ? <Spinner /> : children}
    </button>
  );
};
```

### DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)

**Rule:** If you see 3+ similar code blocks → Extract to component/function

**❌ Bad: Repeated code**
```jsx
// Multiple places with same pattern
<div className="card">
  <img src={user1.avatar} alt={user1.name} />
  <h3>{user1.name}</h3>
  <p>{user1.bio}</p>
</div>

<div className="card">
  <img src={user2.avatar} alt={user2.name} />
  <h3>{user2.name}</h3>
  <p>{user2.bio}</p>
</div>
```

**✅ Good: Extracted component**
```jsx
const UserCard = ({ user }) => (
  <div className="card">
    <img src={user.avatar} alt={user.name} />
    <h3>{user.name}</h3>
    <p>{user.bio}</p>
  </div>
);

// Usage
<UserCard user={user1} />
<UserCard user={user2} />
```

---

## ♿ Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA - MANDATORY)

### Color Contrast

**WCAG AA Requirements:**
- Normal text (< 18px): Contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1
- Large text (≥ 18px or bold ≥ 14px): Contrast ratio ≥ 3:1
- UI components: Contrast ratio ≥ 3:1

**✅ Always check contrast:**
```css
/* Good: High contrast */
.text { color: #000000; background: #FFFFFF; } /* 21:1 ratio */
.button { color: #FFFFFF; background: #0066CC; } /* 8.6:1 ratio */

/* Bad: Low contrast (fails WCAG) */
.text { color: #999999; background: #CCCCCC; } /* 1.4:1 ratio ❌ */
```

### Keyboard Navigation

**All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible:**

```jsx
// ✅ Keyboard accessible
<button
  onClick={handleClick}
  onKeyDown={(e) => e.key === 'Enter' && handleClick()}
  tabIndex={0}
>
  Submit
</button>

// ✅ Custom interactive element
<div
  role="button"
  onClick={handleClick}
  onKeyDown={(e) => (e.key === 'Enter' || e.key === ' ') && handleClick()}
  tabIndex={0}
  aria-label="Close dialog"
>
  ×
</div>
```

### ARIA Labels & Roles

**✅ Always provide:**
- Meaningful labels
- Appropriate roles
- State indicators

```jsx
// ✅ Accessible button
<button
  aria-label="Close dialog"
  aria-pressed={isPressed}
  aria-expanded={isExpanded}
>
  ×
</button>

// ✅ Accessible form
<form role="search">
  <label htmlFor="search-input">Search products</label>
  <input
    id="search-input"
    type="search"
    aria-describedby="search-hint"
    aria-required="true"
  />
  <span id="search-hint">Enter at least 3 characters</span>
</form>

// ✅ Accessible navigation
<nav aria-label="Main navigation">
  <ul role="list">
    <li><a href="/" aria-current="page">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

### Alt Text for Images

```jsx
// ✅ Descriptive alt text
<img src="user-profile.jpg" alt="Profile photo of John Doe" />

// ✅ Decorative images (empty alt)
<img src="decorative-pattern.svg" alt="" role="presentation" />

// ❌ Missing alt text
<img src="photo.jpg" /> // Fails accessibility
```

### Touch Targets (Mobile)

**Minimum touch target size: 44x44 pixels**

```css
/* ✅ Mobile-friendly button */
.button {
  min-width: 44px;
  min-height: 44px;
  padding: 12px 24px;
  touch-action: manipulation;
}

/* ✅ Spacing between touch targets */
.nav-item {
  margin: 8px; /* At least 8px spacing */
}
```

---

## 📱 Responsive Design (Mobile-First)

### Mobile-First Approach

**✅ Always start with mobile, enhance for desktop:**

```css
/* Mobile first (320px+) */
.container {
  padding: 16px;
  font-size: 16px;
}

/* Tablet (768px+) */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    padding: 24px;
    font-size: 18px;
  }
}

/* Desktop (1024px+) */
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .container {
    padding: 32px;
    max-width: 1200px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
}

/* Large desktop (1440px+) */
@media (min-width: 1440px) {
  .container {
    padding: 48px;
    max-width: 1400px;
  }
}
```

### Breakpoint Strategy

```javascript
// Standard breakpoints
const breakpoints = {
  mobile: '320px',   // Small phones
  tablet: '768px',   // Tablets
  laptop: '1024px',  // Laptops
  desktop: '1440px', // Desktop monitors
  wide: '1920px'     // Large screens
};
```

### Flexible Units

**✅ Use relative units, not pixels:**

```css
/* ✅ Good: Flexible, scales with user preferences */
.text { font-size: 1rem; }        /* 16px default, scales */
.container { max-width: 80%; }    /* Percentage */
.spacing { padding: 2em; }        /* Relative to font size */
.height { height: 100vh; }        /* Viewport height */

/* ❌ Bad: Fixed, doesn't scale */
.text { font-size: 16px; }
.container { max-width: 1200px; }
.spacing { padding: 32px; }
```

### Responsive Images

```jsx
// ✅ Responsive with srcset
<img
  src="image-800.jpg"
  srcSet="
    image-400.jpg 400w,
    image-800.jpg 800w,
    image-1200.jpg 1200w
  "
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 800px"
  alt="Product photo"
  loading="lazy"
/>

// ✅ Next.js Image component (auto-optimized)
<Image
  src="/product.jpg"
  alt="Product photo"
  width={800}
  height={600}
  layout="responsive"
  loading="lazy"
  placeholder="blur"
/>
```

---

## ⚡ Performance Optimization

### Lazy Loading

**✅ Lazy load routes and heavy components:**

```jsx
// Lazy load routes
import { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

const Dashboard = lazy(() => import('./pages/Dashboard'));
const Settings = lazy(() => import('./pages/Settings'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />} />
        <Route path="/settings" element={<Settings />} />
      </Routes>
    </Suspense>
  );
}

// Lazy load heavy components
const Chart = lazy(() => import('./components/Chart'));
const VideoPlayer = lazy(() => import('./components/VideoPlayer'));
```

### Code Splitting

```javascript
// Split by feature
const AdminPanel = lazy(() => import('./features/admin'));

// Split vendor chunks (webpack/vite config)
optimization: {
  splitChunks: {
    chunks: 'all',
    cacheGroups: {
      vendor: {
        test: /[\/]node_modules[\/]/,
        name: 'vendors',
        priority: 10
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Image Optimization

```jsx
// ✅ Perfect: WebP with fallback, lazy loading, dimensions
<picture>
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp" />
  <img
    src="image.jpg"
    alt="Descriptive alt text"
    width="800"
    height="600"
    loading="lazy"
  />
</picture>
```

### Minimize Re-renders

```jsx
import { memo, useMemo, useCallback } from 'react';

// ✅ Memoize expensive components
const ExpensiveComponent = memo(({ data }) => {
  return <div>{/* ... */}</div>;
});

// ✅ Memoize expensive calculations
const sortedData = useMemo(() => {
  return data.sort((a, b) => a.value - b.value);
}, [data]);

// ✅ Memoize callbacks
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
  doSomething(id);
}, [id]);
```

### Debounce/Throttle

```jsx
// ✅ Debounce search input
import { useMemo } from 'react';
import { debounce } from 'lodash';

const debouncedSearch = useMemo(
  () => debounce((query) => fetchResults(query), 300),
  []
);

<input onChange={(e) => debouncedSearch(e.target.value)} />
```

## 🔍 SEO Best Practices

### Semantic HTML

```jsx
// ✅ Semantic HTML structure
<header>
  <nav aria-label="Main navigation">
    <a href="/">Home</a>
  </nav>
</header>

<main>
  <article>
    <h1>Page Title</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Section Heading</h2>
      <p>Content...</p>
    </section>
  </article>

  <aside>
    <h2>Related Content</h2>
  </aside>
</main>

<footer>
  <p>&copy; 2025 Company Name</p>
</footer>

// ❌ Non-semantic (bad for SEO)
<div class="header">
  <div class="nav">
    <div class="link">Home</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Meta Tags (Every Page Must Have)

```jsx
// ✅ Complete meta tags
<head>
  <title>Page Title - Max 60 characters</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Compelling 150-160 char description" />
  <meta name="keywords" content="keyword1, keyword2, keyword3" />

  {/* Open Graph */}
  <meta property="og:type" content="website" />
  <meta property="og:url" content="https://yoursite.com/page" />
  <meta property="og:title" content="Page Title" />
  <meta property="og:description" content="Description" />
  <meta property="og:image" content="https://yoursite.com/image.jpg" />

  {/* Twitter Card */}
  <meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
  <meta name="twitter:url" content="https://yoursite.com/page" />
  <meta name="twitter:title" content="Page Title" />
  <meta name="twitter:description" content="Description" />
  <meta name="twitter:image" content="https://yoursite.com/image.jpg" />

  {/* Mobile */}
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <meta name="theme-color" content="#000000" />

  {/* Canonical */}
  <link rel="canonical" href="https://yoursite.com/page" />
</head>
```

## 🏗️ API Design Principles

### RESTful API Best Practices

**✅ Resource-oriented URLs:**
```
GET    /api/users              # List users
POST   /api/users              # Create user
GET    /api/users/:id          # Get user
PUT    /api/users/:id          # Update user
DELETE /api/users/:id          # Delete user

GET    /api/users/:id/orders   # Get user's orders
POST   /api/users/:id/orders   # Create order for user
```

**✅ Use proper HTTP methods and status codes:**
```javascript
// GET - Retrieve data
app.get('/api/users/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const user = await User.findById(req.params.id);
  if (!user) return res.status(404).json({ error: 'User not found' });
  res.status(200).json(user);
});

// POST - Create resource
app.post('/api/users', async (req, res) => {
  const user = await User.create(req.body);
  res.status(201).json(user); // 201 Created
});

// PUT - Update resource
app.put('/api/users/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const user = await User.findByIdAndUpdate(req.params.id, req.body, { new: true });
  if (!user) return res.status(404).json({ error: 'User not found' });
  res.status(200).json(user);
});

// DELETE - Remove resource
app.delete('/api/users/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const user = await User.findByIdAndDelete(req.params.id);
  if (!user) return res.status(404).json({ error: 'User not found' });
  res.status(204).send(); // 204 No Content
});
```

**✅ Versioning:**
```
/api/v1/users
/api/v2/users
```

**✅ Pagination, filtering, sorting:**
```javascript
// GET /api/users?page=2&limit=20&sort=-createdAt&status=active
app.get('/api/users', async (req, res) => {
  const { page = 1, limit = 20, sort = '-createdAt', status } = req.query;

  const query = status ? { status } : {};
  const users = await User.find(query)
    .sort(sort)
    .skip((page - 1) * limit)
    .limit(Number(limit));

  const total = await User.countDocuments(query);

  res.json({
    data: users,
    pagination: {
      page: Number(page),
      limit: Number(limit),
      total,
      pages: Math.ceil(total / limit)
    }
  });
});
```

### Error Handling

**✅ Consistent error responses:**
```javascript
// Standard error format
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid email format",
    "field": "email",
    "details": [...]
  }
}

// Error handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);

  // Validation errors
  if (err.name === 'ValidationError') {
    return res.status(400).json({
      error: {
        code: 'VALIDATION_ERROR',
        message: err.message,
        details: err.errors
      }
    });
  }

  // Not found errors
  if (err.name === 'NotFoundError') {
    return res.status(404).json({
      error: {
        code: 'NOT_FOUND',
        message: err.message
      }
    });
  }

  // Authentication errors
  if (err.name === 'UnauthorizedError') {
    return res.status(401).json({
      error: {
        code: 'UNAUTHORIZED',
        message: 'Invalid or expired token'
      }
    });
  }

  // Generic server errors
  res.status(500).json({
    error: {
      code: 'INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR',
      message: 'An unexpected error occurred'
    }
  });
});
```

## 🗄️ Database Design

### Schema Design Best Practices

**✅ Normalize data appropriately:**
```javascript
// User model
const userSchema = new Schema({
  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true, index: true },
  username: { type: String, required: true, unique: true, index: true },
  passwordHash: { type: String, required: true },
  profile: {
    firstName: String,
    lastName: String,
    avatar: String
  },
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
  updatedAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
});

// Order model (references user)
const orderSchema = new Schema({
  userId: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true, index: true },
  items: [{
    productId: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Product', required: true },
    quantity: { type: Number, required: true, min: 1 },
    price: { type: Number, required: true }
  }],
  total: { type: Number, required: true },
  status: { type: String, enum: ['pending', 'paid', 'shipped', 'delivered'], default: 'pending', index: true },
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
});
```

### Indexing for Performance

**✅ Index frequently queried fields:**
```javascript
// Single field index
userSchema.index({ email: 1 });

// Compound index (order matters!)
orderSchema.index({ userId: 1, status: 1, createdAt: -1 });

// Text search index
productSchema.index({ name: 'text', description: 'text' });

// Unique index
userSchema.index({ username: 1 }, { unique: true });
```

### Query Optimization

**✅ Use projections (select only needed fields):**
```javascript
// ❌ Bad: Fetch all fields
const users = await User.find();

// ✅ Good: Fetch only needed fields
const users = await User.find().select('username email profile.avatar');
```

**✅ Use lean() for read-only queries:**
```javascript
// ❌ Bad: Returns full Mongoose documents (slower)
const users = await User.find();

// ✅ Good: Returns plain JavaScript objects (faster)
const users = await User.find().lean();
```

**✅ Avoid N+1 queries with populate:**
```javascript
// ❌ Bad: N+1 query problem
const orders = await Order.find();
for (const order of orders) {
  order.user = await User.findById(order.userId); // N queries!
}

// ✅ Good: Single join query
const orders = await Order.find().populate('userId', 'username email');
```

### Transactions (for critical operations)

```javascript
// ✅ Use transactions for multi-step operations
const session = await mongoose.startSession();
session.startTransaction();

try {
  // Deduct from sender
  await Account.findByIdAndUpdate(
    senderId,
    { $inc: { balance: -amount } },
    { session }
  );

  // Add to receiver
  await Account.findByIdAndUpdate(
    receiverId,
    { $inc: { balance: amount } },
    { session }
  );

  // Commit transaction
  await session.commitTransaction();
} catch (error) {
  // Rollback on error
  await session.abortTransaction();
  throw error;
} finally {
  session.endSession();
}
```

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Authentication

**✅ Secure JWT implementation:**
```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

// Generate JWT token
function generateToken(user) {
  return jwt.sign(
    {
      id: user._id,
      email: user.email,
      role: user.role
    },
    process.env.JWT_SECRET,
    { expiresIn: '7d' }
  );
}

// Hash password
async function hashPassword(password) {
  return bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
}

// Verify password
async function verifyPassword(password, hash) {
  return bcrypt.compare(password, hash);
}

// Auth middleware
function requireAuth(req, res, next) {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.replace('Bearer ', '');

  if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Authentication required' });
  }

  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    req.user = decoded;
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid or expired token' });
  }
}

// Role-based authorization
function requireRole(...roles) {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    if (!req.user) {
      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Authentication required' });
    }

    if (!roles.includes(req.user.role)) {
      return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Insufficient permissions' });
    }

    next();
  };
}

// Usage
app.post('/api/admin/users', requireAuth, requireRole('admin'), async (req, res) => {
  // Only admins can access this endpoint
});
```

### Password Reset Flow

```javascript
// Step 1: Request password reset
app.post('/api/auth/forgot-password', async (req, res) => {
  const { email } = req.body;
  const user = await User.findOne({ email });

  if (!user) {
    // Don't reveal whether email exists
    return res.json({ message: 'If email exists, reset link sent' });
  }

  // Generate reset token (expires in 1 hour)
  const resetToken = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex');
  user.resetToken = await bcrypt.hash(resetToken, 10);
  user.resetTokenExpiry = Date.now() + 3600000; // 1 hour
  await user.save();

  // Send email with reset link
  await sendEmail({
    to: user.email,
    subject: 'Password Reset',
    text: `Reset link: https://yourapp.com/reset-password?token=${resetToken}&email=${email}`
  });

  res.json({ message: 'If email exists, reset link sent' });
});

// Step 2: Reset password with token
app.post('/api/auth/reset-password', async (req, res) => {
  const { email, token, newPassword } = req.body;

  const user = await User.findOne({
    email,
    resetTokenExpiry: { $gt: Date.now() }
  });

  if (!user || !(await bcrypt.compare(token, user.resetToken))) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid or expired reset token' });
  }

  // Update password
  user.passwordHash = await hashPassword(newPassword);
  user.resetToken = undefined;
  user.resetTokenExpiry = undefined;
  await user.save();

  res.json({ message: 'Password reset successful' });
});
```

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### Input Validation

**✅ Always validate and sanitize input:**
```javascript
const { body, validationResult } = require('express-validator');

app.post('/api/users',
  // Validation rules
  body('email').isEmail().normalizeEmail(),
  body('username').isLength({ min: 3, max: 30 }).trim().escape(),
  body('password').isLength({ min: 8 }),

  async (req, res) => {
    // Check validation results
    const errors = validationResult(req);
    if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
      return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });
    }

    // Proceed with validated data
    const user = await User.create(req.body);
    res.status(201).json(user);
  }
);
```

### SQL Injection Prevention

**✅ Use parameterized queries:**
```javascript
// ❌ Bad: SQL injection vulnerability
const userId = req.params.id;
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`; // DANGEROUS!
db.query(query);

// ✅ Good: Parameterized query
const userId = req.params.id;
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?';
db.query(query, [userId]);

// ✅ Good: ORM (Mongoose, Sequelize)
const user = await User.findById(req.params.id);
```

### Rate Limiting

**✅ Prevent abuse with rate limiting:**
```javascript
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

// General rate limit
const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // Max 100 requests per window
  message: 'Too many requests, please try again later'
});

// Stricter limit for auth endpoints
const authLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
  max: 5, // Max 5 login attempts per window
  message: 'Too many login attempts, please try again later'
});

app.use('/api/', limiter);
app.use('/api/auth/', authLimiter);
```

### CORS Configuration

**✅ Configure CORS properly:**
```javascript
const cors = require('cors');

app.use(cors({
  origin: process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS?.split(',') || 'http://localhost:3000',
  credentials: true,
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization']
}));
```

---

## ⚡ Performance Optimization

### Caching

**✅ Cache frequently accessed data:**
```javascript
const redis = require('redis');
const client = redis.createClient();

// Cache middleware
async function cacheMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  const key = `cache:${req.originalUrl}`;

  try {
    const cached = await client.get(key);
    if (cached) {
      return res.json(JSON.parse(cached));
    }

    // Store original res.json
    const originalJson = res.json.bind(res);
    res.json = (data) => {
      // Cache for 5 minutes
      client.setex(key, 300, JSON.stringify(data));
      originalJson(data);
    };

    next();
  } catch (error) {
    next();
  }
}

// Usage
app.get('/api/products', cacheMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
  const products = await Product.find().lean();
  res.json(products);
});
```

### Background Jobs

**✅ Offload heavy tasks to background jobs:**
```javascript
const Bull = require('bull');
const emailQueue = new Bull('email-queue');

// Add job to queue
app.post('/api/users', async (req, res) => {
  const user = await User.create(req.body);

  // Send welcome email asynchronously
  await emailQueue.add({
    to: user.email,
    template: 'welcome',
    data: { username: user.username }
  });

  res.status(201).json(user);
});

// Process jobs
emailQueue.process(async (job) => {
  await sendEmail(job.data);
});
```

### Database Connection Pooling

**✅ Use connection pooling:**
```javascript
// Mongoose connection pooling
mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI, {
  poolSize: 10, // Maintain up to 10 connections
  serverSelectionTimeoutMS: 5000,
  socketTimeoutMS: 45000
});

// PostgreSQL connection pooling
const { Pool } = require('pg');
const pool = new Pool({
  max: 20, // Maximum connections
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000
});
```

exports.findByEmail = async (email) => {
  return User.findOne({ email }).lean();
};
```

## 🎯 Key Principles

- **RESTful Design** - Resource-oriented URLs, proper HTTP methods
- **Validation First** - Always validate and sanitize input
- **Security Always** - OWASP Top 10, parameterized queries, rate limiting
- **Error Handling** - Consistent error responses, proper status codes
- **Performance Matters** - Caching, indexing, connection pooling
- **Transactions** - Use for critical multi-step operations
- **Separation of Concerns** - Layered architecture (controller/service/repository)
- **Documentation** - Document all endpoints (OpenAPI/Swagger)

## 🐳 Containerization

### Docker Best Practices

**✅ Multi-stage builds for smaller images:**
```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:24-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Copy source code
COPY . .

# Build application
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
FROM node:24-alpine AS production
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only necessary files from builder
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY package*.json ./

# Security: Run as non-root user
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs && \
    adduser -S nodejs -u 1001
USER nodejs

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD node -e "require('http').get('http://localhost:3000/health', (r) => process.exit(r.statusCode === 200 ? 0 : 1))"

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]
```

**✅ .dockerignore for smaller context:**
```
node_modules
npm-debug.log
.git
.gitignore
.env
.env.local
dist
coverage
.vscode
*.md
.github
```

### Docker Compose for Local Development

**✅ Complete development stack:**
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@db:5432/myapp
      - REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/node_modules
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis
    command: npm run dev

### Secrets Management

**✅ Kubernetes secrets:**
```bash
# Create secret from literal values
kubectl create secret generic myapp-secrets \
  --from-literal=database-url=postgresql://... \
  --from-literal=jwt-secret=supersecret

# Create secret from env file
kubectl create secret generic myapp-secrets \
  --from-env-file=.env.production

# Use secret in deployment (already shown above in env section)
```

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Logging

### Health Checks

**✅ Implement health check endpoint:**
```javascript
// Express health check
app.get('/health', async (req, res) => {
  const checks = {
    uptime: process.uptime(),
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    status: 'OK'
  };

  // Check database connection
  try {
    await db.ping();
    checks.database = 'healthy';
  } catch (error) {
    checks.database = 'unhealthy';
    checks.status = 'DEGRADED';
  }

  // Check Redis connection
  try {
    await redis.ping();
    checks.redis = 'healthy';
  } catch (error) {
    checks.redis = 'unhealthy';
    checks.status = 'DEGRADED';
  }

  const statusCode = checks.status === 'OK' ? 200 : 503;
  res.status(statusCode).json(checks);
});
```

### Logging Best Practices

**✅ Structured logging:**
```javascript
const winston = require('winston');

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: process.env.LOG_LEVEL || 'info',
  format: winston.format.combine(
    winston.format.timestamp(),
    winston.format.errors({ stack: true }),
    winston.format.json()
  ),
  defaultMeta: {
    service: 'myapp',
    environment: process.env.NODE_ENV
  },
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.Console({
      format: winston.format.combine(
        winston.format.colorize(),
        winston.format.simple()
      )
    }),
    new winston.transports.File({
      filename: 'logs/error.log',
      level: 'error'
    }),
    new winston.transports.File({
      filename: 'logs/combined.log'
    })
  ]
});

// Usage
logger.info('User login', { userId: user.id, ip: req.ip });
logger.error('Database connection failed', { error: error.message });
```

### Prometheus Metrics

**✅ Expose Prometheus metrics:**
```javascript
const promClient = require('prom-client');

// Create a Registry
const register = new promClient.Registry();

// Add default metrics (CPU, memory, event loop lag)
promClient.collectDefaultMetrics({ register });

// Custom metrics
const httpRequestDuration = new promClient.Histogram({
  name: 'http_request_duration_seconds',
  help: 'Duration of HTTP requests in seconds',
  labelNames: ['method', 'route', 'status_code'],
  buckets: [0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5]
});

register.registerMetric(httpRequestDuration);

// Middleware to track request duration
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const start = Date.now();
  res.on('finish', () => {
    const duration = (Date.now() - start) / 1000;
    httpRequestDuration.labels(req.method, req.route?.path || req.path, res.statusCode).observe(duration);
  });
  next();
});

// Metrics endpoint
app.get('/metrics', async (req, res) => {
  res.set('Content-Type', register.contentType);
  res.end(await register.metrics());
});
```

## 🏗️ Infrastructure as Code

### Terraform Example

**✅ AWS infrastructure with Terraform:**
```hcl
# main.tf
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"

  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "myapp-terraform-state"
    key    = "production/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-1"
  }

  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}

# VPC
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block           = "10.0.0.0/16"
  enable_dns_hostnames = true
  enable_dns_support   = true

  tags = {
    Name        = "${var.project_name}-vpc"
    Environment = var.environment
  }
}

# ECS Cluster
resource "aws_ecs_cluster" "main" {
  name = "${var.project_name}-cluster"

  setting {
    name  = "containerInsights"
    value = "enabled"
  }
}

# Load Balancer
resource "aws_lb" "main" {
  name               = "${var.project_name}-alb"
  internal           = false
  load_balancer_type = "application"
  security_groups    = [aws_security_group.alb.id]
  subnets            = aws_subnet.public[*].id

  enable_deletion_protection = var.environment == "production"
}
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment

**✅ Zero-downtime deployment:**
```bash
# Deploy new version to "green" environment
kubectl apply -f deployment-green.yaml

# Wait for green to be healthy
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l version=green

# Switch traffic to green
kubectl patch service myapp -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"green"}}}'

# Remove old "blue" deployment
kubectl delete deployment myapp-blue
```

### Rolling Update

**✅ Gradual deployment (Kubernetes default):**
```yaml
strategy:
  type: RollingUpdate
  rollingUpdate:
    maxSurge: 1        # Max 1 extra pod during update
    maxUnavailable: 0  # No downtime
```

---

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### Secrets Management

**✅ Use secret management tools:**
```bash
# AWS Secrets Manager
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
  --name myapp/database-url \
  --secret-string "postgresql://..."

# HashiCorp Vault
vault kv put secret/myapp \
  database-url="postgresql://..." \
  jwt-secret="supersecret"
```

### Environment Variables

**✅ Never commit secrets:**
```bash
# .env.example (commit this)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/myapp
JWT_SECRET=changeme
NODE_ENV=development

# .env (DO NOT COMMIT)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://prod-server:5432/myapp
JWT_SECRET=actual-secret-key
NODE_ENV=production
```

---

## 🎯 Key Principles

- **Automate Everything** - CI/CD for all environments
- **Infrastructure as Code** - Version control infrastructure
- **Monitor Continuously** - Health checks, logs, metrics
- **Security First** - Secrets management, least privilege
- **Zero Downtime** - Rolling updates, blue-green deployments
- **Containerize** - Docker for consistency across environments
- **Scale Horizontally** - Design for multiple instances

/--------------\
```

**Unit Tests (70%):** Fast, isolated, test individual functions/classes
**Integration Tests (20%):** Test component interactions, APIs, database
**E2E Tests (10%):** Test complete user workflows end-to-end

---

## 🧩 Unit Testing

### Best Practices

**✅ Test one thing at a time:**
```javascript
// ✅ Good: Single responsibility
describe('calculateTotal', () => {
  it('should sum all item prices', () => {
    const items = [{ price: 10 }, { price: 20 }];
    expect(calculateTotal(items)).toBe(30);
  });

  it('should return 0 for empty array', () => {
    expect(calculateTotal([])).toBe(0);
  });

  it('should ignore items without price', () => {
    const items = [{ price: 10 }, { name: 'test' }];
    expect(calculateTotal(items)).toBe(10);
  });
});

// ❌ Bad: Testing multiple things
it('should calculate total and format currency', () => {
  // Testing two different responsibilities
});
```

### Naming Convention

**✅ Descriptive test names:**
```javascript
// Pattern: "should [expected behavior] when [condition]"
it('should return user when valid ID provided', () => { });
it('should throw error when user not found', () => { });
it('should hash password when creating user', () => { });
```

### AAA Pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)

**✅ Structure all tests with AAA:**
```javascript
it('should create order with correct total', async () => {
  // Arrange - Setup test data
  const items = [
    { id: 1, price: 10, quantity: 2 },
    { id: 2, price: 5, quantity: 3 }
  ];
  const user = { id: 'user-123' };

  // Act - Execute the function
  const order = await createOrder(user, items);

  // Assert - Verify the result
  expect(order.total).toBe(35); // (10*2) + (5*3)
  expect(order.userId).toBe('user-123');
  expect(order.items).toHaveLength(2);
});
```

### Test Fixtures and Factories

**✅ Use factories for test data:**
```javascript
// test/factories/user.factory.js
const userFactory = (overrides = {}) => ({
  id: 'user-123',
  email: 'test@example.com',
  username: 'testuser',
  role: 'user',
  createdAt: new Date('2025-01-01'),
  ...overrides
});

// Usage in tests
describe('User Service', () => {
  it('should update user email', async () => {
    const user = userFactory({ email: 'old@example.com' });
    const updated = await userService.updateEmail(user.id, 'new@example.com');
    expect(updated.email).toBe('new@example.com');
  });
});
```

---

## 🔗 Integration Testing

### API Testing

**✅ Test API endpoints:**
```javascript
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('../app');

describe('POST /api/users', () => {
  it('should create user with valid data', async () => {
    const userData = {
      email: 'test@example.com',
      username: 'testuser',
      password: 'SecurePass123!'
    };

    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/users')
      .send(userData)
      .expect(201);

    expect(response.body).toMatchObject({
      email: userData.email,
      username: userData.username
    });
    expect(response.body.password).toBeUndefined(); // Shouldn't return password
  });

  it('should return 400 for invalid email', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/users')
      .send({ email: 'invalid-email', username: 'test', password: 'pass' })
      .expect(400);

    expect(response.body.error).toBeDefined();
  });

  it('should return 409 for duplicate email', async () => {
    await User.create({ email: 'test@example.com', username: 'test1', password: 'pass' });

    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/users')
      .send({ email: 'test@example.com', username: 'test2', password: 'pass' })
      .expect(409);
  });
});
```

### Database Testing

**✅ Test with real database (test environment):**
```javascript
const { setupTestDB, teardownTestDB } = require('./test-helpers/db');

describe('User Repository', () => {
  beforeAll(async () => {
    await setupTestDB();
  });

  afterAll(async () => {
    await teardownTestDB();
  });

  beforeEach(async () => {
    // Clear data before each test
    await User.deleteMany({});
  });

  it('should find user by email', async () => {
    const user = await User.create({
      email: 'test@example.com',
      username: 'test',
      password: 'hashedpass'
    });

    const found = await userRepository.findByEmail('test@example.com');
    expect(found.id).toBe(user.id);
  });
});
```

### Authentication Testing

**✅ Test protected routes:**
```javascript
describe('GET /api/users/me', () => {
  it('should return 401 without token', async () => {
    await request(app)
      .get('/api/users/me')
      .expect(401);
  });

  it('should return current user with valid token', async () => {
    const user = await User.create({ email: 'test@example.com', username: 'test' });
    const token = generateToken(user);

    const response = await request(app)
      .get('/api/users/me')
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${token}`)
      .expect(200);

    expect(response.body.email).toBe(user.email);
  });

  it('should return 401 with expired token', async () => {
    const expiredToken = generateToken({ id: 'user-123' }, { expiresIn: '0s' });

    await request(app)
      .get('/api/users/me')
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${expiredToken}`)
      .expect(401);
  });
});
```

  });
});
```

### Cypress Example

**✅ Cypress E2E tests:**
```javascript
describe('Checkout Flow', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.visit('/products');
    cy.login('test@example.com', 'password'); // Custom command
  });

  it('should complete purchase successfully', () => {
    // Add items to cart
    cy.get('[data-testid="product-1"]').click();
    cy.get('[data-testid="add-to-cart"]').click();

    // Go to cart
    cy.get('[data-testid="cart-icon"]').click();
    cy.url().should('include', '/cart');

    // Verify cart items
    cy.get('[data-testid="cart-item"]').should('have.length', 1);

    // Proceed to checkout
    cy.get('[data-testid="checkout-button"]').click();

    // Fill shipping info
    cy.get('input[name="address"]').type('123 Test St');
    cy.get('input[name="city"]').type('Test City');
    cy.get('input[name="zip"]').type('12345');

    cy.get('input[name="expiry"]').type('12/25');
    cy.get('input[name="cvv"]').type('123');

    // Submit order
    cy.get('button[type="submit"]').click();

    // Verify success
    cy.url().should('include', '/order-confirmation');
    cy.get('[data-testid="order-success"]').should('be.visible');
  });
});
```

## 🎭 Mocking & Stubbing

### Mock External APIs

**✅ Mock HTTP requests:**
```javascript
const nock = require('nock');

describe('Weather Service', () => {
  it('should fetch weather data', async () => {
    // Mock external API
    nock('https://api.weather.com')
      .get('/forecast')
      .query({ city: 'New York' })
      .reply(200, {
        temperature: 72,
        conditions: 'Sunny'
      });

    const weather = await weatherService.getWeather('New York');

    expect(weather.temperature).toBe(72);
    expect(weather.conditions).toBe('Sunny');
  });

  it('should handle API errors', async () => {
    nock('https://api.weather.com')
      .get('/forecast')
      .query({ city: 'Invalid' })
      .reply(404);

    await expect(weatherService.getWeather('Invalid')).rejects.toThrow('City not found');
  });
});
```

### Mock Database Queries

**✅ Mock database with Jest:**
```javascript
jest.mock('../models/User');
const User = require('../models/User');

describe('User Service', () => {
  it('should find user by ID', async () => {
    // Mock database query
    User.findById.mockResolvedValue({
      id: 'user-123',
      email: 'test@example.com',
      username: 'testuser'
    });

    const user = await userService.findById('user-123');

    expect(User.findById).toHaveBeenCalledWith('user-123');
    expect(user.email).toBe('test@example.com');
  });
});
```

### Spy on Functions

**✅ Verify function calls:**
```javascript
describe('Email Service', () => {
  it('should send welcome email on user creation', async () => {
    const sendEmailSpy = jest.spyOn(emailService, 'send');

    const user = await userService.create({
      email: 'test@example.com',
      username: 'test'
    });

    expect(sendEmailSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
      to: 'test@example.com',
      template: 'welcome',
      data: expect.objectContaining({ username: 'test' })
    });

    sendEmailSpy.mockRestore();
  });
});
```

---

## 📊 Code Coverage

### Coverage Goals

**✅ Aim for meaningful coverage:**
- **Statements:** 80%+
- **Branches:** 75%+
- **Functions:** 80%+
- **Lines:** 80%+

**⚠️ Coverage is not quality - 100% coverage doesn't mean bug-free!**

### Generate Coverage Report

**✅ Jest coverage:**
```bash
# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Generate HTML report
npm test -- --coverage --coverageReporters=html

# View uncovered lines
npm test -- --coverage --collectCoverageFrom='src/**/*.js'
```

### Focus on Critical Paths

**✅ Prioritize testing:**
1. **Authentication/Authorization** - Security-critical
2. **Payment Processing** - Financial risk
3. **Data Validation** - Prevent corruption
4. **API Endpoints** - User-facing
5. **Business Logic** - Core functionality

---

## 🧪 Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

**✅ Follow TDD workflow:**

1. **Red** - Write failing test first
```javascript
// Test written first (will fail)
it('should calculate discount correctly', () => {
  const price = 100;
  const discount = 20; // 20% discount
  expect(calculateDiscount(price, discount)).toBe(80);
});
```

2. **Green** - Write minimal code to pass
```javascript
function calculateDiscount(price, discount) {
  return price - (price * discount / 100);
}
```

3. **Refactor** - Improve code quality
```javascript
function calculateDiscount(price, discountPercent) {
  if (price < 0 || discountPercent < 0 || discountPercent > 100) {
    throw new Error('Invalid input');
  }
  return price * (1 - discountPercent / 100);
}
```

---

## 🎯 Testing Best Practices

### DO

- ✅ Test behavior, not implementation
- ✅ Use descriptive test names
- ✅ Follow AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
- ✅ Keep tests independent and isolated
- ✅ Mock external dependencies
- ✅ Test edge cases and error conditions
- ✅ Use factories for test data
- ✅ Run tests frequently during development

### DON'T

- ❌ Test framework code (React, Express, etc.)
- ❌ Test third-party libraries
- ❌ Write tests dependent on execution order
- ❌ Use production database for tests
- ❌ Ignore failing tests
- ❌ Write tests just for coverage percentage
- ❌ Test private methods directly

---

## 📝 Test Documentation

**✅ Document complex test scenarios:**
```javascript
describe('Payment Processing', () => {
  /**
   * This test verifies that the payment system correctly handles
   * insufficient funds by rolling back the order and notifying the user.
   *
   * Scenario:
   * 1. User attempts to purchase items
   * 2. Payment gateway returns insufficient funds error
   * 3. System should:
   *    - Rollback order creation
   *    - Not charge the user
   *    - Return appropriate error message
   */
  it('should handle insufficient funds gracefully', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

---

## 🎯 Key Principles

- **Test Pyramid** - Many unit, some integration, few E2E
- **AAA Pattern** - Arrange, Act, Assert
- **TDD** - Write tests first when possible
- **Independence** - Tests should not depend on each other
- **Clarity** - Descriptive names and clear assertions
- **Mock External** - Isolate code under test
- **Coverage ≠ Quality** - Focus on meaningful tests
- **Fast Tests** - Keep unit tests under 100ms

## 💻 Code Documentation

### JSDoc Standards

**✅ Document all public APIs:**

```javascript
/**
 * Calculate the total price of items in a cart.
 *
 * @param {Object[]} items - Array of cart items
 * @param {string} items[].id - Item ID
 * @param {number} items[].price - Item price in cents
 * @param {number} items[].quantity - Item quantity
 * @param {Object} [options] - Optional configuration
 * @param {number} [options.taxRate=0] - Tax rate as decimal (0.1 = 10%)
 * @param {number} [options.discount=0] - Discount amount in cents
 * @returns {number} Total price in cents including tax and discount
 * @throws {TypeError} If items is not an array
 * @throws {Error} If any item has invalid price or quantity
 *
 * @example
 * const items = [
 *   { id: '1', price: 1000, quantity: 2 },
 *   { id: '2', price: 500, quantity: 1 }
 * ];
 * const total = calculateTotal(items, { taxRate: 0.1 });
 * console.log(total); // 2750 (2500 + 10% tax)
 */
function calculateTotal(items, options = {}) {
  if (!Array.isArray(items)) {
    throw new TypeError('Items must be an array');
  }

  const { taxRate = 0, discount = 0 } = options;

  const subtotal = items.reduce((sum, item) => {
    if (typeof item.price !== 'number' || item.price < 0) {
      throw new Error(`Invalid price for item ${item.id}`);
    }
    if (typeof item.quantity !== 'number' || item.quantity < 1) {
      throw new Error(`Invalid quantity for item ${item.id}`);
    }
    return sum + (item.price * item.quantity);
  }, 0);

  const total = subtotal - discount;
  const withTax = total * (1 + taxRate);

  return Math.round(withTax);
}
```

### TypeScript Documentation

**✅ Use TSDoc for TypeScript:**

```typescript
/**
 * User authentication service.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This service handles all authentication operations including
 * login, registration, password reset, and token management.
 *
 * @public
 */
export class AuthService {
  /**
   * Authenticate user with email and password.
   *
   * @param email - User's email address
   * @param password - User's password (will be hashed)
   * @returns Promise resolving to authentication result
   * @throws {AuthError} If credentials are invalid
   *
   * @example
   * \`\`\`typescript
   * const authService = new AuthService();
   * const result = await authService.login('user@example.com', 'password123');
   * console.log(result.token);
   * \`\`\`
   */
  async login(email: string, password: string): Promise<AuthResult> {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

### Inline Comments

**✅ When to comment:**

```javascript
// ✅ Good: Explain WHY, not WHAT
// Using exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the API
const delay = Math.pow(2, retryCount) * 1000;

// ✅ Good: Explain non-obvious business logic
// Tax rate changes at $1000 threshold per IRS regulation 2024-001
const taxRate = subtotal > 100000 ? 0.25 : 0.20;

// ❌ Bad: Obvious comment
// Increment counter by 1
counter++;

// ❌ Bad: Commented-out code (delete instead)
// const oldFunction = () => { ... };
```

## Context

We need to choose a database for our application. The main requirements are:
- Support for complex queries and joins
- ACID compliance for financial transactions
- Strong data consistency guarantees
- Mature ecosystem and tooling

## Decision

We will use PostgreSQL as our primary database.

## Rationale

**Pros:**
- ACID compliance ensures data consistency
- Powerful query capabilities (JOINs, subqueries, CTEs)
- JSON support for semi-structured data
- Excellent performance with proper indexing
- Mature tooling (pgAdmin, DBeaver, etc.)
- Strong community and documentation

**Cons:**
- More complex setup than MongoDB
- Requires schema design upfront
- Vertical scaling limitations (mitigated by read replicas)

## Alternatives Considered

### MongoDB
- ❌ Eventual consistency doesn't meet our requirements
- ❌ Limited JOIN support
- ✅ Better for rapidly changing schemas

### MySQL
- ✅ ACID compliant
- ❌ Less advanced features than PostgreSQL
- ❌ JSON support less mature

## Consequences

- Database migrations required for schema changes
- Team needs PostgreSQL training
- Can leverage advanced features like full-text search, materialized views
- Need to setup connection pooling (pgBouncer)

## 📝 Documentation Style Guide

### Writing Style

**✅ DO:**
- Use active voice: "Run the command" not "The command should be run"
- Be concise and direct
- Use present tense: "The function returns" not "The function will return"
- Define acronyms on first use: "Application Programming Interface (API)"
- Use consistent terminology throughout

**❌ DON'T:**
- Use jargon without explanation
- Assume knowledge level
- Write overly long paragraphs
- Use ambiguous pronouns (it, this, that)

### Formatting

**✅ Consistent formatting:**

- **Code:** `inline code` or ```language blocks```
- **Commands:** Prefix with `$` for shell: `$ npm install`
- **File paths:** Use backticks: `src/index.js`
- **Emphasis:** Use **bold** for important terms, *italic* for subtle emphasis
- **Lists:** Use numbered lists for sequential steps, bullets for unordered items
- **Headings:** Use hierarchy: # Title, ## Section, ### Subsection
