## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Users

**Installation:**
```bash
# Always install from official npm registry
npm install -g ux-ingka-kit

# Verify package integrity
npm audit ux-ingka-kit

# Check installed version
ux-ingka --version
```

**Configuration:**
```bash
# Never commit secrets or credentials
# Add sensitive files to .gitignore:
.env
.env.local
*.key
*.pem
credentials.json

# Use environment variables for sensitive data
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-token-here"
```

**GitHub CLI Authentication:**
```bash
# Use secure authentication
gh auth login

# Verify authentication status
gh auth status

# Use tokens with minimal required scopes
```

**Project Security:**
```bash
# Regularly update dependencies
npm update -g ux-ingka-kit

# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Review generated files before committing
git diff
```

### For Contributors

**Development:**
```bash
# Use latest Node.js LTS version
node --version  # >= 16.0.0

# Install dependencies securely
npm ci  # Instead of npm install

# Run security checks
npm audit
npm audit fix

# Never commit sensitive data
git secrets --install  # (optional security tool)
```

**Code Review:**
- Review all PRs for security implications
- Check for hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Validate input sanitization

## 🚫 Known Limitations & Risks

### Low Risk (Informational)

**1. GitHub CLI Dependency**
- **Risk:** LEO depends on `gh` CLI being installed and authenticated
- **Mitigation:** Clear error messages guide users to authenticate
- **Impact:** Cannot create issues/projects without authentication

**2. File System Access**
- **Risk:** LEO creates/modifies files in project directory
- **Mitigation:** User consent required, files only in project scope
- **Impact:** Users should review generated files before committing

**3. Template Execution**
- **Risk:** Templates create files and directories
- **Mitigation:** All templates are included in package, no external sources
- **Impact:** Only pre-approved templates can be used

### No Known High-Risk Vulnerabilities

As of October 19, 2025, no high or critical vulnerabilities are known.
